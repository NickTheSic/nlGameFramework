Theme: Annoying Ads
Special Object: Turrent
A Classic TD game where enemies come from the Right and you play as a gunman on the left.
When you need to reload an AD pops up; All ads when clicked give the player an upgrade while others don't.
Ads can open to my other Games?  Like open steam for Mythrealm, AoP, My itch page, a game of mine on itch. my youtube etc
Game Framework needs:
    Text Rendering Possibly. Could get away with just different Images
    UI Buttons. Need to click to open or close
    UI System: Need to show UI on screen infront of the game

A pokemon/spectrobes clone.
Mystical Creatures with Elemental Power. All creatures have a base engery but can use fragments to add a dual energy

You are a spider, swinging on a web trail. 
You can press space to lunge forward. 
The goal could be to get as many bugs as you can before you reach the ground
