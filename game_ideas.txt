TODO: Now that I have a linux machine maybe I figure out some way to test on linux...
Emscripten it is I guess

/*** Generic Game Ideas to Further Development of this framework ***/

Breakout:
- Shape Rendering
- Basic Collision
- Text/UI Rendering for points?

Pong:
- Need shape Rendering
- Text rendering for score
- Basic collision
- Basic UI to select 1 or 2 players
- Could network it for the fun of it
- keyboard input
- basic audio

Snake: 
- Basic shapes or Sprite Rendering 
- more of a grid based movement, no physics style collision
- keyboard input
- basic audio
- more complex: specify the next item to get

Peggle:
- physics System; 
--  maybe just balls hitting balls but ball could hit square blocks and roll
- could render just shapes, sprites for more complex
- score
- mouse & keyboard input
- basic audio

Tetris:
- Shape Rendering
- Score Rendering
- Randomization
- Grid based

Shapez/Miner (Auto miner game, make good use of 'equipment' and planning)
- Shape rendering
- Grid based logic
-- Cluster based resource 
-- Placing and handling
- Conveyer belt logic
--- Handle thousands of things??? Or optimize the stuff off screen? 
--- Able to limit items to grid space, each thing moves in jumps

Top Down Racer:
- physics
- keyboard input
- sprites
- sound
- text and UI
- AI 

Bot Battling Game:
- Twisted Metal / Kirby's Air Ride style
-- Arena based Kart game.  Battle friends, get power ups.
-- Probably not in this engine..
- Multiplayer
- Physics
- Pretty much all the basic stuff for a game plus more for multiplayer.

Everything is either AI controlled or controlled by you
- Lakeview cabin style puzzle game
- Sprite Render
- Collision
- Object Interactions...
- Lots of stuff, later game idea

Lakeview Cabin style Puzzle game:
- Sprites
- Physics
- Movement
- Game logic
-- Timers
-- Triggers


/*** Game Jams ***/

https://itch.io/jam/animatronic-nightmare:  Maybe join a team and make a little horror game
- A game about setting up the store the night before?
-- You unpack the animatronics, put em together and put them on stage.
--- Maybe their eyes open and close, fingers move, etc... Creepy stuff
-- You unpack the tables and chairs and set them up
-- You see the animatronics off stage, maybe they change the layout too
-- You could put the bottles on the shelf and they mess with you
-- Ends with them putting you in the last box?
--- What is Needed?
--- - Mouse Interactions
--- - Gameplay Logic for moving items out of grid and put together
--- -- Maybe put same colour together, until sprites and then 3d models
--- - Scene chaning?
--- - 3D animation!  (And 2D)

https://itch.io/jam/palette-cleanser-jam: Could have been a cooler, simpler project to get back into things

https://itch.io/jam/diversion-summer-jam-2025: 
- Try new Version Control; maybe win money?

https://itch.io/jam/cfac-x-micro-2: Probably too soon; but mirco jam is one I have heard of before

https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-192-overflow:  
Done a mini jam before, maybe I won't have time
Overflow makes me think of water or liquid - not sure where the game might be
Building a dam?  Removing water from a place

https://itch.io/jam/untitled-game-jam-115: Heard of the jam before.  Probably can't use this framework as is at the moment

https://itch.io/jam/portfolio-builders-jam-week-35 & https://itch.io/jam/portfolio-builders-jam-week-36: 
Could be another weekly game jam? 
Could be fun to meet weekly goals
Could update off itch things too?

https://itch.io/jam/uplifting-game-jam-for-artists-cash-prizes-doubled: 
Seemed a little more narrative driven, if only cus it needs to be 'uplifting'
Could help force me into text rendering and text handling?
Might actually be good, would need to update UI too; if only for drawing a box to show text in
But I wanted to look into localization stuff on my own.  Maybe a narrative game would help

https://itch.io/jam/unpolished-jam-2-75-prize-pool:
Could be more chill? 
Make a quick project to see how it feels to work with my framework after so long?


/*** Missed game jams below, with an idea that I could use for any game at any time ***/


https://itch.io/jam/mini-jame-gam-40:
Theme: Annoying Ads
Special Object: Turrent
A Classic TD game where enemies come from the Right and you play as a gunman on the left.
When you need to reload an AD pops up; All ads when clicked give the player an upgrade while others don't.
Ads can open to my other Games?  Like open steam for Mythrealm, AoP, My itch page, a game of mine on itch. my youtube etc
Game Framework needs:
    Text Rendering Possibly. Could get away with just different Images
    UI Buttons. Need to click to open or close
    UI System: Need to show UI on screen infront of the game

https://itch.io/jam/gigajam2:
Main Themes: Elemental Power; Mystical Creatures; Lost Realms
Secondary Themes: Origin of Power; Dimensional Conflict; Harmony; Dual Energy; Temporal Flow; Fragments
A pokemon/spectrobes clone.
Mystical Creatures with Elemental Power. All creatures have a base engery but can use fragments to add a dual energy
Dimensional Conflict between lot Realms? One contains the origin of Power

https://itch.io/jam/1-button-jam-2024:
You are a spider, swinging on a web trail. 
You can press space to lunge forward. 
The goal could be to get as many bugs as you can before you reach the ground

https://itch.io/jam/indie-dev-game-jam-5:
You are a fish your goal is to eat as many things before finding the secret lure
if you are big enough you can catch and eat the fisherman instead.
