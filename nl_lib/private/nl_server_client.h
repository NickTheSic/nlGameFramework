/*

Options:

1.
    bool Initialize(...) - Arbitrarily pass in Server or Client related variables

    - Pro: Common Functionality in one place
    - Con: Maybe lots of if/else statements

2.
    bool init_as_server(...) - Explicitly set up as server
    bool init_as_client(...) - Explicitly set up as client

    - Pro: can keep them separate 
    - Con: ... Copy of functionality OR lots of small calls - not necesarily an issue


--- Either way, the game, unless having a server, needs to manage **what** it is
