Github repo for the development of a game framework.  Based on my other frameworks as well as handmade hero.  just a place to mess around in system code.

It would be cool to make this as cross platform as possible. including homebrew sdks.  but that will most likely require turning this from a framework into an engine


feel free to use this for your projects and let me know.  I don't know how much suggestions I'll be taking at this time though.  this is a learning tool for me first and a place to hopefully share the end result of a framework that can compile to many systems.

at the moment you'll be better off using SDL or raylib
